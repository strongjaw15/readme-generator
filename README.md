# Readme Generator

## Description

This is a small app that will write up a README file, based on a boilerplate and using user input to fill in the details. I wanted to make it to help save time when writing README files! I learned about node, inquirer, and the writeFile function while working on this project.

## Installation

Download the repo, open the terminal in the root folder, and run "npm install" to install the dependencies.

## Usage

With the terminal open in the root folder of the project, simply run "node index.js" to start the app. In the assets folder there is an example README which was created by using this program.
